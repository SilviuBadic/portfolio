# Portfolio
This is my portfolio, which contains some of my works, some things about me, skills, hobbies and some anchor links to my Linkedin profile, GitHub and my Curriculum Vitae. I've tried to give it
a custom look and to make it simple and a bit dynamic. The main reason was to make it simple for anyone interested in finding my work with just a few clicks. I've started from scratch, using
some HTML and CSS, and in the end I've added some JavaScript code to make it look a bit dynamic.

## Features
My porfolio contains five main parts:
- First one contains the title, a short introduction with all the animated buttons and achors which lead us to other parts of my porfolio.
- The second one contains my main skills as a developer and designer, and my hobbies too.
- The third one contains some of my projects showing my improvement overtime. The rest of them are listed on my GitHub profile.
- The fourth one contains some basic information about me and my career.
- The last one is the contact form, for anyone interested in findimg more about me.

## Lessons Learned

Sometimes simplicity is cooler than lots of non-sense information.
## Optimizations

Adding JavaScript made my portfolio a bit animated. See the Skills section in which we have to click the button in order to move the image and display the requested skills.
